/*
 * oracle.c -- batch b0098 reference implementation.
 *
 * The original HardenedBSD sources concatenated, with every function renamed
 * with a "ref_" prefix.  Function bodies are UNMODIFIED.
 *
 * Sources, in order:
 *   lib/libc/stdio/vwscanf.c
 *   lib/libc/stdio/vwprintf.c
 *   lib/libc/stdio/setbuf.c
 *
 * Deviations, limited to non-body text:
 *   - <xlocale.h> is not included and the vwscanf_l()/vwprintf_l() functions
 *     are absent: this platform's libc has no locale_t-parameterised
 *     vfwscanf_l()/vfwprintf_l().  See skipped.txt.
 *   - setbuf.c's #include "local.h" is dropped; nothing in the body needs it.
