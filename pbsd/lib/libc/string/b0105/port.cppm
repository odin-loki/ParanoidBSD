// PBSD port of HardenedBSD lib/libc/string, batch b0105.
//
// Sources ported in this module:
//   hbsd/src/lib/libc/string/strspn.c
//   hbsd/src/lib/libc/string/strcspn.c
//   hbsd/src/lib/libc/string/strsep.c
//   hbsd/src/lib/libc/string/wcslcpy.c
//
// The ports are byte-for-byte faithful in behaviour to the C originals,
// including signedness, evaluation order and pointer arithmetic.
