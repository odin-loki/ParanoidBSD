# Building PBSD

`hbsd/src` is a complete HardenedBSD source tree — 107,357 files, 31,887 of
them under `sys/`, with the HardenedBSD kernel configs intact. It builds.

## Before anything else

The tree was committed with **every file mode 100644**. FreeBSD's build runs
its own scripts directly, so it stopped at the first one it tried to exec:

```
contrib/bmake/boot-strap: contrib/bmake/configure: Permission denied
```

That is fixed, and guarded:

```sh
python3 tools/check_exec_bits.py
```

A text file starting with `#!` must be executable; a binary file must not be.
Run it after any bulk import — the same mistake will recur the next time the
tree is copied in rather than merged.

## On FreeBSD (the supported path)

```sh
sh tools/ci/build_boot_image.sh kernel      # ~tens of minutes
sh tools/ci/build_boot_image.sh world       # hours
sh tools/ci/build_boot_image.sh memstick    # bootable USB image
sh tools/ci/build_boot_image.sh iso         # bootable installer ISO
```

Knobs: `KERNCONF` (default `HARDENEDBSD`), `TARGET`/`TARGET_ARCH` (default
`amd64`), `OBJ` (default `/usr/obj/pbsd`), `JOBS`.

Available kernel configs: `HARDENEDBSD`, `HARDENEDBSD-CORE`,
`HARDENEDBSD-MINIMAL`, `HARDENEDBSD-NODEBUG`, plus FreeBSD's `GENERIC`,
`MINIMAL` and the `LINT` variants.

The stages are a ladder on purpose. `kernel` proves the config compiles;
`world` proves the userland does; only then is an image worth the hours.

## In CI

`.github/workflows/pbsd-boot-image.yml`, manual dispatch, pick a stage and a
kernel config. It runs on a FreeBSD VM and uploads `.img`/`.iso` as an
artifact. Start at `kernel` with `HARDENEDBSD-MINIMAL`.

## Cross-building from Linux

`tools/build/make.py` is FreeBSD's own Linux/macOS entry point and does work
for world and kernel:

```sh
cd hbsd/src
sudo apt-get install -y bmake flex bison time libarchive-dev
MAKEOBJDIRPREFIX=/tmp/pbsd-obj \
XCC=/usr/bin/clang XCXX=/usr/bin/clang++ \
XCPP=/usr/lib/llvm-18/bin/clang-cpp XLD=/usr/bin/ld.lld \
python3 tools/build/make.py --host-bindir=/usr/bin -j"$(nproc)" \
    TARGET=amd64 TARGET_ARCH=amd64 kernel-toolchain
```

Verified to reach *stage 1.2, bootstrap tools* on Ubuntu 24.04 with clang 18
— bmake bootstraps and the legacy shims stage completes. The image targets
(`makefs`, `mkimg`) still want a FreeBSD host, so use this to check the tree
compiles and the VM to produce something bootable.

## Why the modes were missing

`hbsd/src` arrived in a single commit with no remote, no submodule and no
vendor branch: a flat copy with upstream history and file modes discarded.
Re-importing it as a vendor branch would have carried the modes, and would
make future upstream a `git merge` rather than another copy. Worth doing
before the next sync.
