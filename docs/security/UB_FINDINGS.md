# Undefined behaviour found by model checking

CBMC over `hbsd/src`, function by function. `tools/verify/README.md` has
the method and the five calibrations it took to make the output mean
anything; this is what it found.

Every entry was **confirmed with UBSan before anything was edited**. One
tool reporting undefined behaviour is one tool's opinion.

## Fixed — the UB was in the *type* of an expression, not its value

For each of these the bit pattern the code computes is what it always
computed. The fix makes an operation defined that hardware was already
performing; nothing observable changes. That is why they were safe to
repair rather than to report.

### `lib/libc/stdbit` — six C23 functions

```c
unsigned int stdc_leading_ones_uc(unsigned char x) {
        const int offset = UINT_WIDTH - UCHAR_WIDTH;   /* 24 */
        return (__builtin_clz(~(x << offset)));
}
```

`x` promotes to `int` (C17 6.3.1.1p2). For `x >= 128`, `x << 24` needs
more than `INT_MAX` — C17 6.5.7p4, undefined. Half the domain of six
functions: `stdc_leading_ones_uc/us`, `stdc_leading_zeros_uc/us`,
`stdc_first_leading_one_uc/us`.

`stdc_first_leading_zero.c` — same author, same month, same directory —
has the `(unsigned int)` cast the other three files omit.

*Verified:* exhaustively against an independent reference that counts bits
in a loop — all 256 `unsigned char` and all 65,536 `unsigned short` values
for each of three operations, **197,376 cases, zero mismatches**, under
UBSan throughout. CBMC afterwards: 70 of 70 functions in the directory
`PROVED`.

### `lib/msun/src/s_rint.c`, `s_rintf.c`

```c
int32_t i0,j0,sx;
sx = (i0>>31)&1;                                  /* 0 or 1 */
SET_HIGH_WORD(t,(i0&0x7fffffff)|(sx<<31));        /* 1 << 31, signed */
```

`rint()` takes that branch for **every negative argument** with
`|x| < 2^52`.

### `lib/msun/src/s_ceil.c`, `s_floor.c`

```c
j = i1 + (1<<(52-j0));
```

`j0` is the unbiased exponent, and the branch runs for `j0` ∈ [21,51]. At
`j0 == 21` the shift is `1 << 31`. `ceil(3000000.5)` reaches it.

Casting the shift to `u_int32_t` also fixes the addition — `i1` is
`int32_t`, so the sum was signed and could overflow independently. The
next line is `if(j<i1) i0+=1;`, a carry check that only means anything
under wrapping, so unsigned is what the code already assumed.

*Verified:* 6,200,000 cases across every `j0` in [21,51], zero mismatches.

## Reported, not fixed — the UB *is* the overflow

For these there is no behaviour-preserving repair. The overflow is the
defect, so defining it means choosing new behaviour for an exported
function on arguments the standard does not bound. That is a product
decision and it is not made here.

| function | expression | reached by |
|---|---|---|
| `lib/libc/gen/nice.c` | `prio + incr` | `nice(INT_MAX)` — `incr` is the caller's `int`; POSIX does not bound it, and glibc clamps where FreeBSD does not |
| `lib/libc/compat-43/killpg.c` | `kill(-pgid, sig)` | `killpg(INT_MIN, sig)` |
| `lib/libc/gen/timezone.c` | `zone = -zone` | `timezone(INT_MIN, dst)` |
| `lib/libc/net/ip6opt.c` | `nbytes += 2` then `(nbytes+7)&~7` | `inet6_option_space(n)` for `n > INT_MAX-2` |

`inet6_option_space` is the one worth a second look: it computes a
**size** from a caller-supplied `int`, and an overflow there produces a
small value where a large one was asked for.

All four confirmed under UBSan.

## Not defects, and why they looked like defects

Kept because the reasoning is what stops them being re-reported.

| reported | why it is not a defect |
|---|---|
| `s_significand.c`: `-ilogb(x)` overflows | `math.h:45` defines `FP_ILOGB0` as `(-__INT_MAX)`, **not** `INT_MIN`, precisely so negation is safe. CBMC does not model `ilogb`, so its return was unconstrained. |
| `s_cosl`, `s_sinl`, `s_tanl`: `-n` overflows | `n` is written by `__ieee754_rem_pio2l`, also unmodelled. |
| `clock()`, `alarm()`, `svc_run()` | the values come from `getrusage`, `setitimer`, unmodelled externs. |
| `strcat`, `stpcpy`, `memrchr`, … | a nondeterministic `char *` includes NULL. These are the functions' *missing preconditions*, not bugs. |
| ~43 `lib/msun` "division by zero" | floating-point division by zero is **defined** by IEEE-754, and msun depends on it for `log(0)`, `logb`, `rsqrt` and `catrig`. |
| `nsap_addr.c:xtob`, `getopt_long.c:gcd` | `static`. Their callers constrain the domain; a modular check does not see callers. |
